Its a big thing and it doesnt work at all
DO NOT attempt to build this, the pcb design sucks and there is no code for it (well there is but it doesnt do much - it definitly doesnt output triggers or gates)
its an upcoming project of mine. I got stuck on multiple muxers running on the same clock
Im working on the sequencer thing for now, Ill let you know when I get back to it
And dont forget to watch my livestreams where you can see me working on modules.
